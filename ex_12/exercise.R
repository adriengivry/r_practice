# Write a "Guess The Number" game.
# Rules:
# - The computer starts by generating a random number between 0 and 100
# - The user try guessing the number by inputting a number
# - The computer then answers:
#   - It's less: if the given number is higher than the expected number
#   - It's more: if the given number is lower than the expected number
#   - Congrats!: If the given number is the expected number
# We do not expect you to ensure that the user input is correct, just assume the user is not a monkey
# Resources:
# - sample(): generates a random number within a given range
# - readline(): reads a line from the terminal (used to retrieve user inputs)
# - as.numeric(): converts characters to a value of type "numeric" (number)
